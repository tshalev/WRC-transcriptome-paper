# Supplementary Data
## List of supplementary data associated with the publication.

* **[Supplementary Data 1](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S1-TPS_full_phylogeny_sequences.fasta)**: Sequences of 241 plant terpene synthase (TPS) used in construction of a maximum-likelihood phylogeny of plant TPS.
* **[Supplementary Data 2](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S2-TPS_gymnosperm_phylogeny_sequences.fasta)**: Sequences of 126 gymnosperm and a single P. patens TPS used in construction of a maximum-likelihood phylogeny of gymnosperm TPS.
* **[Supplementary Data 3](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S3-Line_4_main_gene_set.fasta)**: Sequence data for the core WRC gene set. Gene set containing the 28,279 core, reduced-redundancy protein sequences for predicted ORFs as produced by the EvidentialGene pipeline.
* **[Supplementary Data 4](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S4-Line_4_alternate_gene_set.fasta)**: Sequence data for the alternate WRC gene set. Gene set containing 40,691 additional putative protein-coding sequences, which may be potential gene isoforms or paralogs.
* **[Supplementary Data 5](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S5-Annotation.xlsx)**: Summary of significant BLASTp and InterProScan hits for the main reduced-redundancy gene set of Line 4. BLAST columns are as described in the BLAST Command Line Applications User Manual (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/). The pipeline for BLASTing and filtering hits is described in the Methods section. GO names are separated by Biological Process (P), Molecular Function (F) and Cellular Component (C). The InterPro ID column lists all InterPro domains found for the queried sequence. Top PFAM hit describes the hit with the highest score against the PFAM database for each sequence, using an e-value cut-off of 1e-5.
* **[Supplementary Data 6](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S6-Orthology_species_stats.xlsx)**: Statistical summary of orthogroup analysis for all sequences assigned to orthogroups. Of the 498,235 protein coding sequences from 16 different plant species submitted for orthogroup analysis, 391,179 were successfully assigned to 19,660 orthogroups. The majority of orthogroups (11,616) had an average of less than one gene per species; the largest orthogroup (3201 genes) had an average of 151â€“200 genes per species. A large number of orthogroups (5614) had members from only two species; however, a similarly large number (3835) had members from all 16 species.
* **[Supplementary Data 7](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S7-Orthogroup_analysis_gene_families.xlsx)**: Statistical summary of orthogroup analysis results for each species. The species with the lowest number of genes assigned to orthogroups was P. patens, with only 57.5% of sequences assigned; the highest was P. glauca with 92.4%. 90.4% of our WRC gene set was successfully assigned to orthogroups; 0.1% of WRC sequences were in species-specific orthogroups.
* **[Supplementary Data 8](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S8-Orthology_summary.xlsx)**: Summary of orthogroup composition and function. The number of orthogroup members from each species, together with the total number of genes in each orthogroup and the top five PFAM hits for each orthogroup. The largest orthogroup, with 3201 genes consisted mainly of pentatricopetide-repeat containing protein-coding genes, a large protein family in plants with little functional redundancy (Lurin et al. 2004).
* **[Supplementary Data 9](https://github.com/tshalev/WRC-transcriptome-paper/blob/main/Supplemental%20Data/Dataset_S9-Line_4_putative_full_length_TPS.fasta)**: Sequence data for 33 putative full-length TPS genes from the WRC gene set. Putative TPS were identified using BLASTp, InterProScan and orthogroup analysis, and after removal of partial ORFs and proteins less than 400 aa long were reduced to a set of 33 putative full-length TPS.
